# About
This is **Alpha Release** for KFC Automous Car project.

# catkin workspace and build
In order to use the catvehicle ROS package, you should work within a catkin workspace. If you do not already have one:
```
cd ~
mkdir -p catvehicle_ws/src
cd catvehicle_ws/src
catkin_init_workspace
cd ..
catkin_make
```
At this point, you can clone this Alpha Release to your src directory
```
cd catvehicle_ws/src
git clone https://git.engr.arizona.edu/ece473-573-2017S/kfc.git
cd..
catkin_make
```
# How to run Alpha Release
Notice there is a alpha.launch file in catvehicle_ws/src/kfc/catvehicle/launch directory. You need to run this launch file to start Alpha Release, here is the command:
```
cd catvehicle/src
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch catvehicle alpha.launch
```
At this point, Alpha Release is running, if you want to start the gui to watch how the car is working, open a new terminal and do the following commands:
```
cd catvehicle/src
source devel/setup.bash
gzclient
```
And if you want to see how the car detect objects and produce objects' location, open a new termianl and do the following commands:
```
cd catvehicle/src
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun rviz rviz
```

# Expected Result for this release
In this release, we bascially want to make car circumvent objects in fornt of it. Specificlly, when the car detects a ojbect in 10 feet distance, it starts to turn left. It will not stop turning left until there is no ojbect within 10 feet range. In the meantime, the car can produce rought lcoations for all objects it detects.
